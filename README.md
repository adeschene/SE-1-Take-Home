 # SE 1 Interview Take-Home Project
 
 Build a table similar to https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_domestic_box_office/ (Box Office tab, everything below the search bar and above the copyright statement)

 * The default sorting should be based on weekendRev field in descending order
 * The first column should be the rank (starting at 1) based on the default sort order
 * Clicking a column header should sort by that field
 * Clicking a column header a second time should invert the sort
 * As far as styling goes, no need to worry about small things like matching the font or exact pixel dimensions, but should be close
